# Weather App

This Weather App is a web application that displays current weather information based on the user's location. It was developed with the help of [Code Explained](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeExplained)'s tutorial and starter code. The icons used in the web application were created by the Graphic Designer Ashley Jager and can be found [here](https://github.com/manifestinteractive/weather-underground-icons). The weather data is provided by the API provider [OpenWeatherMap](http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org).

## How to Use

1. Upon opening the Weather App, it will attempt to retrieve your current location using the browser's geolocation feature.
2. If geolocation is supported by your browser, the weather information for your location will be displayed.
3. The weather information includes the weather icon, temperature, description, and location.
4. You can click on the temperature value to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit units.
5. If geolocation is not supported by your browser, a notification will be displayed informing you of the limitation.

## Technologies Used

The Weather App utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It makes use of the Fetch API to retrieve weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The application dynamically updates the UI based on the received weather information.
